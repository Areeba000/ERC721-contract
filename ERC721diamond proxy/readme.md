# Diamond Proxy Contract for ERC721 - README

This document provides an overview of the diamond proxy contract for the ERC721 standard. The diamond proxy contract is a pattern used to implement Ethereum smart contracts that can be upgraded while retaining the same address. It is often used to add, replace, or upgrade functionality in a contract without changing the contract's address.

## 1. Introduction

### Purpose of the Diamond Proxy Contract

The diamond proxy contract is designed to facilitate the upgrade of a contract implementing the ERC721 standard without changing the contract's address. This is achieved by using the diamond proxy pattern, which separates the contract's data storage from its logic, allowing you to add or upgrade functions while keeping the original contract's address.

### ERC721 Standard

The ERC721 standard is used for creating and managing non-fungible tokens (NFTs) on the Ethereum blockchain. The diamond proxy contract can be used to upgrade an ERC721 contract while preserving its NFTs and historical data.

## 2. Contract Structure

### Diamond Proxy Pattern

The diamond proxy pattern separates the contract's logic and storage. The diamond proxy contract acts as a router, directing function calls to the appropriate facet (a separate contract containing the logic). The proxy contract also maintains a mapping of function selectors to the facet that implements them.

### Functionality

The diamond proxy contract supports the following core functionality:

- Adding or upgrading functions: New functions can be added or existing ones can be replaced in separate facets.
- Accessing upgraded functions: Users can call upgraded functions via the proxy contract, which delegates the call to the appropriate facet.
- Storage Slot Usage: Storage slots are allocated for data shared among facets, and the diamond proxy contract ensures that these slots are used consistently.

## 3. Usage

### Adding or Upgrading Functions

To add or upgrade functions in the diamond proxy contract, you create separate facets containing the logic for these functions. Then, you direct the diamond proxy contract to use these facets by registering them.

### Accessing Upgraded Functions

Users can access the upgraded functions by interacting with the diamond proxy contract as if it were the original ERC721 contract. Behind the scenes, the proxy contract routes the function call to the appropriate facet.

### Storage Slot Usage

Ensure that storage slots are used consistently across facets. Storage slots should be allocated for data that needs to be shared among facets, and each facet should read and write to these slots consistently.

## 4. Security Considerations

### Access Control

Implement proper access control mechanisms to restrict who can add or upgrade facets in the diamond proxy contract. Ensure that only authorized users can make these changes.

### Function Authentication

When upgrading functions, validate the authenticity of the new facet to prevent malicious upgrades. Use a secure method to authenticate facets.

## 5. Getting Started

### Deployment

To deploy the diamond proxy contract, you need to create and deploy the facets first. Then, configure the diamond proxy contract to use these facets. Deployment should be done through a secure and audited process.

### Interacting with the Diamond Proxy Contract

Users can interact with the diamond proxy contract as if it were the original ERC721 contract. Calls to the proxy contract are automatically directed to the appropriate facet, based on the function selector.
